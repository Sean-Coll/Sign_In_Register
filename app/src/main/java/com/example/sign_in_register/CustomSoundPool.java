/* This class provides simplified use of the SoundPool class which is used to play a collection
 * of short audio files. The sequence for setting up a CustomSoundPool is:
 * CustomSoundPool() the default constructor
 * setCon(Context con) this sets the context for the other methods. Calling this is required for
 * the object to work.
 * initialise() this initialises the attributes for the object and specifies that its usage is for
 * accessibility purposes and its content type is speech.
 * load(int resId) the resId should be R.raw.fileId. The priority for each file loaded will always
 * be 1.
 * play(int soundId) this will play the sound specified with a volume of 1, it won't loop and
 * the speed is normal.
 * release() use this when the activity is ending or the SoundPool isn't needed anymore.
